I write about tech when I have something on my mind I want to share. That
doesn't happen too often, but should, I know.

Anyway, these posts are mostly opinionated, as opposed to soulless articles
that don't really say anything. For soulless stuff to get it done I have my
wiki

You can check [about]({{< ref "/about" >}}) or these are my latest articles ðŸ‘‡
