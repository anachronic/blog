title: About Me

I'm a software engineer currently @ [SAWA](https://sawa.cl). I do a bit of
everything, but what I enjoy mostly these days is doing DevOps work. I also do
a bit of python and general backend work.

I've done my fair bit of software engineering back in the day. Some Java @
[Arbol-logika](https://arbol-logika.com), Python @ [Calce](https://calce.cl)
and [IMFD](https://imfd.cl), then moved to doing some Ruby @
[Fintual](https://fintual.com) just to back to doing python and some PHP ðŸ˜¨ @
[SAWA](https://sawa.cl).

I've had my interests take a shift over the years and I've gone through a
little bit of everything, just to test what I like, but as I said, what I've
enjoyed the most is DevOps work.
