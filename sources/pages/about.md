I'm a software engineer, currently working at [IMFD](https://www.imfd.cl),
where I develop apps with Vue and Python. I grew up in Copiapó, Chile and am
located in Santiago right now.

I started working [Arbol Logika S.A.](https://www.web.arbol-logika.com/) where I
did an internship as a Java developer. It was in this internship where I fell
in love with web development and I met great people.

I moved on to work at [Calce SpA](https://www.calce.cl/) where I developed a
system dedicated to manage requests for a 3D printing system. The stack was
full Django. These guys do cool technology. Check out their work!

After that I went back to Arbol Logika and carried on with some Java development.

And I now work as a Vue and Django engineer at IMFD. I'm interested in
learning GraphQL and React. I've been having a good time using these
technologies lately.
