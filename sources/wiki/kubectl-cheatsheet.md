The thing that I always forget. I had even made a note about this and lost it ðŸ™„

## Contexts

If there's more than 1 config/cluster in your machine

- `kubectl config current-context`
- `kubectl config get-contexts`
- [`kubectl config set-context`](https://jamesdefabia.github.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl/kubectl_config_set-context/)

I'm no expert to decide whether this is a good thing. I imagine that in a serious place/config one wouldn't be `kubectl`ing all the time (possibly never). But should still be needed from time to time. Especially for learning purposes.

## Getting what's inside

- `kubectl get X` where `X` could be `po`, `service`, `deploy`, `secret`, `ingress` and many more.
- pass `-n` to switch namespaces. I imagine that namespaces are a generally accepted good practice
- `kubectl rollout status <deployment>`. Not sure about the `<deployemnt>` part. Should be easy to look up in the docs tho
- `kubectl logs pod/<pod_name>` get logs IN POD. They (afaik) cannot be gotten from deployments. It's better to set up a logging stack
- restart a deployment with `kubectl rollout restart deploy/<deploy_name>`. Often needed when changing secrets/configmaps
- `kubectl exec -it pod/<pod_name> -- bash` run bash inside a pod. Don't use this. Don't abuse it. It' never a good idea
- `kubectl apply -f <manifest>` to apply a manifest. Good for setting up and pipelines. Actually not sure about the pipeline part, but does the job.
- `kubectl port-forward service/<service> <port_here>:<port_there>` to bind locally `<port_here>` to the service's `<port_there>`.
- create a namespace with `kubectl create namespace <name>`. Or just `apply -f` a manifest

## Stuff I couldn't find ðŸ‘‡

- creating a configmap from file
- creating secrets from literals. This was always a serious pain in the ass. I should figure out a better way than `--from-literal`
- ðŸ‘† use `opaque` secrets for general secrets (like db credentials) and `docker-registry` for docker pulling secrets ([docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#docker-config-secrets))
- everything about vcs and pvcs. I couldn't get myself to understand those in depth.
